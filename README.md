# GNA-KUL-2017-2018
These files contain all assignments during my time in the course GNA. These are 3 projects of which all code and reports are of my ownership, Liam Volckerick.
I DO NOT ENDORSE ANY FORM OF PLAGIARISM. If you are using any of this code, I have nothing to do with this. Use at own risk. 

Practicum1: SortingAlgorithms

Practicum2: Puzzle8-Solver

Practicum3: Algorithm for sewing pictures together.


note: Assignment 1's solution might have some errors due to not being fully correctly implemented. Assignment 2 and 3 are correct.
